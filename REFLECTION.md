# Reflection

## Were your predictions right?
Yes, most of my predictions were right except for my most frequent mood. I predicted "productive" but in reality my most frequent mood was "tired."

## What surprised you?
I knew that increased caffeine intake probably did not improve focus, and this was confirmed by the data showing no clear benefit. I assumed that caffeine would help my productivity, but it clearly has no clear benefit. 

## What was tricky or rewarding?
Translating subjective moods, feelings, or focus into data that a program could analyze was probably the most challenging aspect of this exercise. 

## How did using your own data change things?
Using my own data helped to make this exercise more engaging. It was interesting to see how much sleep I actually get any given week. It was interesting to quantify my caffeine intake and relate that and the amount of sleep I get into productiveness.
